## <a name="introduction">🤖 Introduction</a>

AWS Auto Scaling groups (ASGs) let you easily scale and manage a collection of EC2 instances that run the same instance configuration. You can then manage the number of running instances manually or dynamically, allowing you to lower operating costs. Since ASGs are dynamic, Terraform does not manage the underlying instances directly because every scaling action would introduce state drift. You can use Terraform lifecycle arguments to avoid drift or accidental changes.

Terraform is an infrastructure as code (Iac) tool that automates infrastructure provisioning. It is the most popular and offers support for multiple clouds.

In this tutorial, you will use Terraform to provision and manage an Auto Scaling group and learn how Terraform configuration supports the dynamic aspects of the resource. You will launch an ASG with traffic managed by a load balancer and define a scaling policy to automatically modify the number of instances running in the group. You will learn how to use lifecycle arguments to avoid unwanted scaling of your ASG.

## <a name="steps">☑️ Steps</a>

The procedure for deploying this architecture on AWS consists of the following steps:

* Create a VPC, Subnets, and Configure network requirements.
* Create EC2 instances with Auto scaling group and Launch template.
* Create a Load balancer with a target group to the Auto Scaling group.


## 📝 Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes that you are familiar with the standard Terraform workflow. If you are new to Terraform, complete the [Get Started tutorials](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started) first.

For this tutorial, you will need:

* [Terraform v1.8+ installed locally](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli).
    
* An [AWS account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup) with [credentials configured for Terraform](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#authentication).
    
* The [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)


## ➡️ Step 1 - Initialise Project

Create an empty project directory and create a file called `main.tf` within it.

Firstly we need to add information about the provider (Here, we will be using AWS Provider). We will also configure AWS credentials, so we could provision resources in the AWS cloud.

<summary><code>main.tf</code></summary>

```bash
# terraform apply -var-file="app.tfvars" -var="createdby=e2esa"

locals {
  tags = {
    Project     = var.project
    createdby   = var.createdby
    CreatedOn   = timestamp()
    Environment = terraform.workspace
  }
}

module "aws_lb" {
  source = "../../modules/e2esa-module-aws-elb"
  #source             = "git::https://github.com/e2eSolutionArchitect/terraform.git//providers/aws/modules/e2esa-module-aws-elb?ref=main"
  name                       = var.project
  internal                   = var.lb_internal
  load_balancer_type         = var.lb_load_balancer_type
  security_groups            = var.lb_security_groups
  subnets                    = var.lb_subnets
  enable_deletion_protection = var.lb_enable_deletion_protection

  lb_target_port = var.lb_target_port
  lb_protocol    = var.lb_protocol
  lb_target_type = var.lb_target_type
  vpc_id         = var.vpc_id

  lb_listener_port     = var.lb_listener_port
  lb_listener_protocol = var.lb_listener_protocol

  tags = local.tags
}
```
